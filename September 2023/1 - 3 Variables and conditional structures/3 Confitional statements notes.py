    #block = a group of consecutive statements that are at the same leve in structure of the program (with the same intendation)

    # data type = cam be any value being used in the program
    #function = can execute functionality(ties), can also include parameters/arguments
    #syntax = "home rules", decides how the code of the program should be written.
    #debug = the program has correct syntax however, it does not work. There is a bug
        # removing the bug to reach the expected result is called debigging
